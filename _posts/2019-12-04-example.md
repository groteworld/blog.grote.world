  It's testing out a new theme for a new concept. More than a <a href="https://twitter.com/groteworld">tweet</a>; 
  less than a <a href="https://github.com/groteworld">repo</a>. The perfect little blog for small ideas...

70 character `monospaced` code lines means that I should be able to do all the programming examples I need. If it doesn't then I need to refactor the code. Simplicity and straight forward wins the game AMIRITE?

 ```
// This is a test of the 70 character limit inside of the code blocks.
function hello(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
}

hello('World');
```
